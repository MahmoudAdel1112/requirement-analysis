##Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository acts as a quick reference and outline for completing requirement analysis, a fundamental stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This project, aims to record, analyze and structure requirements for a **Booking Management System**, similar to a real-world development scenario.

By following industry standard practice, this project aims to assist developers and analysts to:

- Understand the principles behind requirement gathering  
- Be able to distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements  
- Produce clear use case diagrams using Draw.io  
- Understand and define acceptance criteria against business requirements  

The structured documents and visualizations included in this repository should assist learners to develop a solid foundation in software planning and design to ensure that their projects are clear, precise, and scalable.

Whether you are a student, aspiring developer or a professional wanting to enhance your documentation skills, this repository will give you practical experience writing well-considered requirement analysis documents that can ultimately be used in a successful software delivery process.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental early development phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of the stakeholders are identified, assessed, and documented. The requirement analysis phase means comprehension has been achieved on what the software system needs to fulfill in order to meet user systems and business objectives. Requirement analysis consists of gathering information from many different entities such as end user, client, domain subject matter experts, and developers.  
Ultimately required analysis's aims is to come up with a definitive , clear, and complete , set of requirements that reflects what the stakeholders expect so that further phases of design and development can commence.  
This phase is usually represents the last step before the development/ coding or systems design phase commences. When well-established requirement analysis is accomplished, everyone involved with the development perceives and understands what the requirements are and often how the software might operate in different possibilities/conditions.

## Understanding the Types of Requirements

There are multiple categories of requirements that help define the needs for the system's scope and function. Functional requirements refer to the behaviours, or functions, that the system must provide; for example, the system must allow a user to log in to a specific account or it must allow a user to make a booking. Non-functional requirements refer to the system's performance, usability, consistency, and security; for example, response time, usability and data protection levels. In addition to the functional and non-functional requirements, there are constraints that impact the development process from things like budget, technology, and regulations. All of the requirements combined provide a whole picture of what the system must deliver.

## Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Requirement Analysis is the first step of the project life cycle and is critical to the success of your project. This is because without a clear definition of what the system needs to accomplish, the best team in the world can build a system that does not meet user expectations or business need. By getting the requirements defined early, your team will avoid potential misunderstandings, minimize the chances of project failure and make the entire project development easier.
 
One of the biggest advantages of this phase is that you are able to plan better and estimate the work. When the requirements are defined, it is easier to determine the length of time, the effort and the resources cost, making the estimates more accurate. An accurate Timeline and Budget are important items for any stakeholder, and accurate estimates help keep those basic parameters on track, increasing the chance of developing a project that the stakeholder will be happy with. Well documented requirements are also good for the development and testing teams to refer back to when implementing or verifying the project. 

Another advantage of requirement analysis is that it helps clarify communication for everyone involved in the project. In other words, everyone (both internal employees and external stakeholders i.e. client, end user) share a common vision of what they will receive. With the proper communication and understanding of the project, project miscommunication is greatly reduced, the number of changes requests later in the project are minimized and overall client/end user satisfaction with the delivered system increased.

## Tools and Techniques Used in Requirement Analysis

To successfully perform requirement analysis, professionals typically utilize a host of available tools and techniques. If an analyst is interested in diagramming system interactions, tools like Draw.io or Lucid chart will help produce use case diagrams and flowcharts. If an analyst needs to collaboratively write and maintain requirement specifications, documentation tools like Confluence are very useful. If an analyst wishes to capture and keep track of requirements through the development lifecycle, project management applications like Jira or Trello exist that could help prioritize requirements. Prototyping applications like Figma or Balsamiq could also aid analysts in creating mockups that clarify user interface interpretations.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
## Requirement Analysis Ensures Shared Understanding

Requirement Analysis is designed to provide developers, testers, clients, and end users with a common understanding of what the software needs to do. The lack of clear requirements introduces a higher risk of misunderstandings and questions of scope when features are added without a clear plan. This can lead to delays, cost overruns, and unsatisfied users. By being specific and documenting the requirements early, teams can ensure everyone is on the same page and avoid making changes to previously agreed-upon requirements that result in additional work after development has already begun.

## Identifying Issues Early Reduces Risk and Cost

Finding and fixing issues is dramatically less expensive during the requirement analysis phase compared to making fixes after development has begun or the product has been deployed. Requirement Analysis gives teams an opportunity to identify potential flaws, discrepancies, or missing elements before any code is produced. Taking this approach allows for minimal changes later in development and significantly reduces the chances of costly rework, project failure, or missed deadlines. Overall, this enables a more manageable and predictable delivery throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Clear Requirements Guide Development and Testing

Requirements that are clear and well-structured become the foundation for the development team. Development teams can use these requirements to build system architecture and write source code, while testing teams can use the documentation to develop test scenarios that validate whether the software operates as intended. When requirements are not solid, there is the potential for both testing and development teams to deviate in their implementation, leading to software that is incomplete and of low quality. Requirement Analysis provides clarity, ensuring that every component of the system has a defined purpose and measurable success criteria.

##Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository acts as a quick reference and outline for completing requirement analysis, a fundamental stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This project, aims to record, analyze and structure requirements for a **Booking Management System**, similar to a real-world development scenario.

By following industry standard practice, this project aims to assist developers and analysts to:

- Understand the principles behind requirement gathering  
- Be able to distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements  
- Produce clear use case diagrams using Draw.io  
- Understand and define acceptance criteria against business requirements  

The structured documents and visualizations included in this repository should assist learners to develop a solid foundation in software planning and design to ensure that their projects are clear, precise, and scalable.

Whether you are a student, aspiring developer or a professional wanting to enhance your documentation skills, this repository will give you practical experience writing well-considered requirement analysis documents that can ultimately be used in a successful software delivery process.
